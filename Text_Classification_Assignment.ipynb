past several years devised algorithm which call wrote computer program calculate every major league players contribution using works like every situation every game baseball season situation determined inning score where baserunners many outs there each situation count many times team eventually game that situation occured divide number times situation came come with value that situation this first done late early reported investigation strategies operations research volume julyaugust later same thing using simulated seasons generate larger data avoid kind smallsample anomalies that other people have worried about reported this modified method some work what called measure based these situational values were based directly marginal runs though probabilities these results applied season were reported books example situation might inning score runner second outs there were regular season major league games last year this situation came those team ahead them then value this situation description look change probability based plus baserunning credit debit player that amount each time gets plate appearance each player atbat baserunning values season obtain overall value that player obviously players values each game season whole will that only because always credit batter pitcher there validation involved there very problem here that nobody commented adding probabilities probabilities runs total team runs breaks down into many runs contributed plus many runs contributed probabilities work that increases team chance winning each that does mean that increased team chance winning fact doesn mean anything because units screwy agree disagree saying that batters efforts will resultin more wins then losses while probably correct that does mean more wins then losses means something wouldrather have player increased teams chances winning ineach then would player increased chances winningby each thus there appears association between statistic winning games thus before disregard this stat appears that further study mustgo into what sort relationship there consider hits solo bottom first about your scale does same thing again fourth with score tied another again seventh with score tied another finally ninth game score value solo plate appearances credited your method with what does that mean responsible certainly defense always responsible wasn pitching fact only offense which even close furthermore what about other team runs they came solo then hitting game which just valuable take lead will himself have accrued good rating combined have amassed game there clearly problem here only problem here insistance that these number mean exactlyhow many wins team first using averages over manyseasons applying them game second remember some take away from chance winning that aplayer gets gets negative probability most cases thus sure given game when numbersfor team that they will that game sometimes they will more then sometime less than also pitchers performances have giventhem large negative percentage that game also batter thatpulled night would give large negatives greg thinking about right things intuition mark closers enormously important total number runs value outweighed when they come prevented from comming doubling which greg allows enough another article proposed test this predict team lost record quite accurately looking many runs total they score allow without regard when those runs score game late runs really more important than early runs then looking only late runs should lead better predictor right really only because have smaller sample size wouldthink however that number runs score first inningwould just good prediction many runs score last inning realize something else closer usuallycomes close situation blow hard arguethat runs that closer gives game have equal importanceto those given first inning closer giving runsoften means team will lose many games other hand starterwho gives runs often still leaves team chance theoffence many more outs something about notsaying late inning situations equally important either down runs ninth really does matter manyruns pitcher gives ninth here another thought apply this method basketball what find that points scored first half game have almost exactly value because lead safe with entire half play furthermore bench sinks winning free throws with time clock gets game while star forward scored points first half before spraining ankle gets zero does this make sense would assume that teams probability winning wouldbe before possesion which free throws were made down point with seconds left there fairly that will game possesion theball forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls defense caused negative chance that teamwould from reading discussion this statistic feel that thosewho critisize certain extent doing agenda first look this statistic valadates clutchness reallydoes cluthness revolves around idea that certain playersin crucial situation elevate their performance others down have never seen convincing proof that this really happens assume there clutchness then that means that exceptfor noice this statistic positive association toplayer performance there noice youdo believe clutchness certainly could find whatthe average value home example find forinstance that home increases your chance winning average while strikeout decreases your chance winning this were done would find that this statistic justas good other statistics have predicting wins losses evaluate

teacher first then have teacher leave whatever then will make statement waco take couple questions just hold going live that until that done probably will work better will give time problem have twominute warning problem problem about teacher would walk then think that just trying work this here think that best handle series questions about president handled notifications yesterday instance talk justice department about would come discuss what happened waco whether should attorney general president just take step even farther back from that look whole sequence events contact between justice department white house know have said president spoke with attorney general sunday sunday afternoon they good discussion about minutes attorney general informed president what wanted raised objections obviously implicit authority from president forward raised objections went forward they discussion general nature about incident yesterday morning around president spoke with attorney general again they brief discussion over what happening waco know this before fire broke compound think that there some just some confusion think that confusing minds before after fire actual when they spoke then there number contacts number different levels white house yesterday afternoon between justice department white house they were informing their decisions what they would like there briefing waco attorney general press conference president then issued statement after that yesterday afternoon know there fair amount confusion over exactly what happening ground waco think that wanted very careful have president anything until much better sense what actually happening ground once were fairly clear what happening ground waco president issued statement spoke with attorney general again yesterday evening what hour that quite late believe after returned from holocaust museum took tour holocaust museum last night went dinner believe briefly went dinner then spoke with attorney general last night know exact time think relatively late just said think reported that just wanted tell that thought handled difficult situation very well that good tough situation that should some sleep then again spoke with this morning about followup waco about what they going this afternoon know president will have announcement make ever talk with yesterday last night this morning knowledge point white house general white house liaison several people talked attorney general running operation tell that should sleep well that done good just tell that should some sleep think sleep well done good know exact words think that sounds right mean sleep well implications conscience whether should feel badly about mean think everybody feels badly when have situation when understand that whether issue blame brought that phraseology think that spirit nothing with that spirit with which offered that entire administration certainly attorney general face very difficult decision very difficult situation yesterday that thought that handled well best could does think mishandled just speaking warm words friend does think situation mishandled president retrospect president stands decisions enforcement agencies decisions attorney general accepts full responsibility same time think that want look future figure what exactly happened full review make sure what make sure this doesn happen this kind thing doesn happen again least know handle much know about what going ahead with know that made case explained outlined case action sunday precisely what action think specific operational detail what going happen think that they general discussion about action about advisability action think noted asked general questions just trying sense things were considered wasn minutebyminute detail operation going going tear mean what believe that want take some action that would increase pressure those compound hopefully spur them towards some sort movement there ever conscious political decision made even discussion about distancing president from mean were close contact with justice department president accepts responsibility this same time mean just wanted very very clear about this happened factual could decisions were made responsibility those ground make attorney general operational control over this president obviously accepts responsibility this stands attorney general there report television today know more than that members cult said going into courthouse that started fire themselves there also picture yesterday smashing into building where fire broke question white house absolutely certain that this fire evidence have that this fire started those inside compound every evidence have president attorney general this this particular date about possible consequences either death injury know specific questions general questions about decision going about being made those general questions generally think asked have considered consequences have considered know asked question know asked that specific question tell terms stuff that come since then about information provided listening device about getting increasingly more violent certain much specific detail they into know that generally said that this recommendation prepared make mean decision prepared make based receiving from field after intensive questioning those involved know precisely detailed beyond that what president understanding yesterday people went into compound couple weeks came over weekend with some speculation that have told enforcement people something that precipitated this action yesterday this first have heard think what what attorney general said there were indications that those inside compound were some danger clear that negotiations broken down judgment experts involved negotiations that situation going better there also some concern over vulnerability agents themselves been working long beyond time that these teams normally have work attorney general said there some concern over fact that they have replacements place could stand them there concern over safety these factors came into play they also considered advice number psychologists other experts those compound would just back what attorney general said have make best judgment given information have time they obviously regret loss life terribly unfortunate situation wish could have turned differently that doesn take away from judgments that were made time when president know that they were going tear before assault compound just know believe given detail exactly operation would just know along that point whether plan presented president attorney general standoff other yesterday think presented increase pressure those compound hoped move some those bring wasn presented tomorrow dday this president satisfied that this relevant information necessary make decision that relevant information necessary make decision think satisfied that they were acting best advice best information they secondguessing whatsoever there hour between conversations between president attorney general other words they spoke they didn speak again until back from dinner think that likely call what time call there between when called mean dinner when called think called last night couldn swear believe called last night just wanted talk what going that know what know about situation everyone perished except eight nine know other details know more details than reported waco watching keeping track what going wasn talking attorney general keeping track what going here mean with respect that doing there also said several people white house were constant contact with their counterparts justice have full complete information were those contacts mean president being kept informed believe contact with spoke with several people justice department believe spoke with people justice department either also contact different times during with people justice department were fully briefed fully informed were told this morning that president have spoken chance that have spoken with know that true think there chance have believe think there certainly chance that have some point believe think that last contact during yesterday directly with justice department phone call with attorney general white house fully informed minutetominute basis what happening waco what happening justice department decided that briefing would done attorney general attorney general white house communications staff were ever involved with that decision were told about nightline macneillehrer that stuff that part there advice from white house about night very good decide have president reaction situation only written statement which traditionally white house distancing president from issue having appear personally saying anything that wasn intent said wanted wait until information hand president also making statement today president made statement yesterday morning president been fully involved after this turned into less than successful operation only statement from president what paper after attorney general already given what amounted major facts this first statement from president only statement from president number after number well first number attorney general gave statement early morning when thing starting move right gave yesterday giving today second point just happens this written statement with sort communications policy thought process involved president wants written statement what knew time thought appropriate president thought appropriate written statement expressing regret expressing support attorney general appropriate personally something personally statement statement under name yesterday during briefing didn president took full responsibility what happened certainly what said just right susan think back transcript mean unless miss something love said that took full responsibility said that made decision that president takes responsibility absolutely took responsibility right check transcript considering little known about what going inside compound even little known washington calling this mass suicide think that knowing what know given actions before during painfully clear that those there were under control stretching little where kids concerned though think that that entirely different matter mean think that must bear responsibility deaths those children absolutely clearly intent creating some kind apocalyptic incident that what still operating completely assumption right mean have evidence know evidence that this mass suicide have evidence that those inside compound fire compound which deaths those inside didn quite hear this might question didn quite hear what time himself statement this know said some stuff this president right after evening news went right when information were working confirmed this morning that investigation president going announce going investigation have someone from outside make sure that colored those would have political stake particularly those whose actions have already been think that clearly justice department will bear responsibility investigation rule often investigations like this having some sort independent involvement well will treasury justice confident that will have problem getting absolutely president reach anybody else advice after meeting with else white house that meeting anyone else from justice believe anybody else there time phone call monday wasn meeting sunday sunday phone call wasn meeting believe might have been there with beyond that think just talked attorney general said that that phone call said that want take action said that will force what think talking about didn know about tear what exactly idea what approving think approving action increase pressure didn matter that mean what information have terms this would proceed presumably would have wanted know minutebyminute general sense think knew that this recommendation those ground recommendation enforcement agencies just know what this when that this recommendation action increase pressure know exactly what told whether going told that tank going left wall punch hole window whether just told generally that they were moving forward that would increase pressure just know hard imagine asking though that presented with best advice about what they should forward with would have agreed some general questions about advice recommendation gave same time would repeat that this based unanimous recommendation enforcement agencies involved would seem that this question about just exactly what detail president informed about nature operation going come again here elsewhere take that question absolutely answer come back with tell that there never meeting strategy session where others decided will written statement from president will have these television broadcasts never called justice department said anyone needs front explaining this once just happened that that spokesman that ever until made decision attorney general that important operational officer charge person made decision take questions this tragic incident guidance from white house certainly didn object sure didn object suggest this plan absolutely strategy clear notify certainly knew about what happened this great detailed process have clearing talking every public information officer every under every rock every place government that something major this could have occurred without discussion between public information people least justice department attorney general made decision attorney general wanted forward seemed like good decision good decision good this hindsight would handle think handled very well wouldn change thing what white house handled part from start finish think that awful broad question certainly going have review reasons investigation look ways future that something like this what learn from incident like this what learn about handle them talking specifically about issue press conferences there wouldn make change first going white house people outside media consultants came with this idea just very reminiscent what guys during campaign thinking like watching nightline after draft story watching there absolutely comparison yesterday there enforcement incident incident ended tragic deaths many many people attorney general involved that decision attorney general made decision that felt responsibility interest public information take questions press order make sure that questions were answered fantastic second question someone knows well understand sort hard believe that might have asked some detailed questions about what intended other words came said going pressure them hard fairly intelligent inquisitive asking what kind both attorney general said that questions general questions have minutebyminute account conversation long conversation think about minutes telephone conversation federal cost this standoff ever consideration terms stepping pressure believe keep saying that president takes full responsibility then refer decision does president accept fact that ultimately decision know what this with this enforcement action military action clearly takes responsibility decisions enforcement agencies involved taken government mean think there just ambiguity about that accepting decision well hers saying decision there difference matter fact decision object that decision clearly takes full responsibility this briefing gone just little over minutes things exchanged what exactly they spend minutes talking about just very general long period time phone conversation awful long phone conversation very important phone conversation think brit asked that take question have said that would things said last night that buck stops here think that direct quotation does president agree with that this case president says accepts full responsibility think what attorney general saying that made decision that going accept responsibility that comes shrinking from that neither president point conversation last night between president attorney general this morning ever offer resignation knowledge even before fire yesterday there were some republicans calling investigation white house concerned about timing those requests trying make political this situation want cast questions about motives those requesting investigation want investigation will have full complete investigation what forum will answer brit question written statement wires will answer question that have taken just sure remind what president doing yesterday afternoon where what meetings involved will have remember series meetings with different members staff during afternoon certainly monitoring situation waco getting periodic reports that well some well believe fair amount press briefing well those reports would have come from would they think talked talked talked follow question their conversation this morning they discuss statement last night response question about whether would resign know felt need that here reassure that have this that come know even came that specifically know that bulk conversation discussing where from here what form investigation didn talk about kind remarkable comment last night about believe asked question response president wants will would think standard response that most cabinet members would give mean conditional statement have need talk about whether personally about whether president wanted know they talked about mean what learned about conversation that largely about investigation itself this just didn come question they talked about take that with brit package record does president want resign know answered this morning absolutely supports good attorney general done good handled difficult situation extremely well does president feel that were down unanimous professional advice from enforcement experts ground president secondguessing that decision those that doesn regret loss life everybody regrets loss life this situation best judgments were made difficult situation based best information minute conversation sunday that correct long yesterday morning know will take that question were these outside experts that they were consulting with experts within have them just sure know that there were several experts also weren there replacements these people unit that small think very small unit think kinds things that investigation will examine there factor here involving director rmally president when wants information doesn only asks attorney general know chain command presidents talk their directors this case throughout this entire siege felt that could pick phone talk from waco expertise from what what think talked director well beginning situation when first broke waco same time attorney general bears ultimate responsibility getting fully briefed from attorney general think ambiguous situation that director some impact president briefed that this evolved mean perfectly appropriate that briefed attorney general that attorney

these questions this might suitable inclusion gill note gamma correction images gill what this gamma stuff anyway although would nice think that image image there complications only there whole bunch ofdifferent image formats there wholelot other technical stuff that makes dealing with images bitcomplicated those things have ever from have probably noticed with most imageviewing programs that some images look some look dark somelook light this this gamma correction need gamma correction correction needed because nature crts cathoderay tubes monitors usually used viewing images youhave some sort real live scene turn into computerimage measuring amount light coming from each point ofthe scene then have created linear this good thing many ways because manipulatethe image values image file were light addingand multiplying will work just like real light real world take image file turn each pixel value into voltageand feed into find that doesn give youan amount light proportional voltage

crtwill image that things cancel getwhat want have this your image most crts crt_gamma somewhere between that does seem complicated problem that display programs gamma correction also sources images give linear images video camerasor video signals general because this imagesalready have some gamma correction done them rarely sure much display those imageswith program that does gamma correction image getscorrected twice looks light display thoseimages with program that doesn gamma correction then willlook vaguely right perfect because gamma correction isnot exactly right particular whose fault this really three things those display programsout there that gamma correction properly another isthat most image formats specify standard gamma ordon have some recording what their gamma correction third thing that many people understand what about create images with varyinggamma least file formats right thing format semistandard recordingthe gamma image jfif file standard specifies that image encoded must have gamma alinear image everyone obeys rules some image loaders allow specify only gamma monitor youare using individual gamma values image trying toview other image viewers

time clock morning crowd about people approximately came back place husband already asleep sleep when upset about something standing running from balcony balcony power remember long though been deliberately turned there were lights whatsoever glad course thought better that then look crowd balcony this morning first time they were building morning never thought that that woman first floor awake watching there were human beings among them goes with pail garbage though needed takinggarbage clock morning used pretext went toward those young people they really were youngsters from balcony could perfectly that they were young boys they spoke when they came said what want they answered want armenian family that lives here pointing toward second floor with their hands says already told

everything ruined those creeps scoundrels they threw everything windows rest from neighbors left right into apartment carried everything that hadn already been smashed taken what think that means that parents those families were unfortunately came opinion that organized that everything been foreseen both beating armenians stripping apartments something order will move armenians take over their apartments have worked honestly whole life check everything about came patriot from china waited nights front consulate general ussr came homeland patriot because knew that party komsomol were holy things when that there wasn anything holy about them that party membership bought that komsomol members joined only personal gain that there were ideals ideas save everything being bought sold understood they could allow that crap like talk more about image that beating when apartmentthey picked under soviet army guard they arrived from over suppress that gangnot only armenians some russian families their children came their apartments andjoined because normal person seen that could stay there with situation what interesting that when left buses rode thought that least group people sure people would basically rise situation would have some compassion armenians would somehow understand injustice what done having analyzed weighed whole thing once calmed down having thought through came conclusion that shared many people didn want their armenian neighbors killed that basically depended that said that wanted calm them downthen possible that didn have people hand whomhe could whisper last minute announce take what into your hands protect neighbors from this massacre those crowds weren such that there controlling them basically they were unarmed they didn have firearms mostly they knives they kinds metal parts like armature shafts sharpened ends special rocks different degree that noticed there aren rocks like those soils they were brought from somewhere though were specially planned saying weighed neighbors wanted defend wasn arranged means that government didn want when crowd moving from city party committee sputnik what there informing there turns crowd doing violence microdistrict mention things didn myself will only talk about things myself witnessed they were microdistrict beginning clock evening when themfrom other building they were somewhere else until midnight clock morning because they came back building theyhadn completely finished making their predatory rounds microdistrict when they returned building told husband police probably going come

when poor soldiers wearing only helmets with shields those unfortunate clubs moved against that when they fell those yearold boys using stones heavy stones beat them death their heads could have guessed that something like that could happen soviet_union under soviet government upshot that this republic been under soviet control long time wanted attention involved were work many people would confirm that tell thetruth have been struggling truth five years there already five years that worked railroad some people there considered demagogue others knows what some think adventure seeker andsome prankster wanted everything right would this people treat another this soviet railroad though railroad were property property some magnate some mafia want will here want will want will something else there black market price everything most brazen coach moscow costs much coach local train costs somuch once when complaining head conductor pool nerve tell maybe even believe this this

where else could complain realized that everything useless root whole thing that goes wants seeit filed written complaint they ground into dust they destroyed still have copy what when general procuracy involved with investigation bloody affair addition information about what what witness gave testimony about mafia railroad they accepted petition know they going pursue because will excuse longer believe things aspired things believed dead they just spit soul stomped everything physically most important spiritually because lose belongings that nonsense thatall comes with time when your soul spit upon when best youyour beliefsare destroyed very difficult restore them want tell incident just know time such astate that didn even take minor things into account here example course minor neighbor ason grade school microdistrict know last name goes school with orrather went school with just sitting apartment trying tomake phone call moscow there important when massacre began three hours phones weren working armenian apartments later several russian apartments fact matter that service shut could call anywhere again means planned come service offfor reason lights went those brats were raging theyliked they weren afraid they about freely they that would slap their hands would dare stop them they knew going tell about incident this little anarmenian went school with they were same class according what neighbor saidat time thesame apartment they were phone waiting call putthrougha attacked building where lived tohis mother said please what they killhim maybe still alive maybe bring here save somehow nice like good person smart mother wouldn tears says because afraid says around crowd will just watch just have look they made through know think isparents lived microdistrict when they there they made superficial deduction knowing that balconies doors were being broken everywhere that could from street which were armenian apartments building they went here there looked that windows were intact they calmed down even though windows that apartment were broken everything inside totally smashed there with broken skull mother father already been murdered little didn even know they were dead weeks know critical condition maybe left march spent some time moscow then came been about month already hard keep this straight next when found that family hasbeen killed ling semashko hospital andhis classmates together went visit they wouldn admit them telling them that critical condition that still coma they cried left having also found that girl being kicked dragged that hospital turns brought there serious condition least alive time when club would first friend then another throw ourselves into their arms kiss them because wondered these friends were alive those friends were alive andwhen them were glad find that family lived people heard things that made your hair stand publish everything that happened will hideous book book things even difficult believe those girls were raped were entirely black blue ones they know lying that girlfriend came them said what happened bared breasts they were completely covered cigarette burns those rogues cigarettes breasts after something like that know live city look people when stayed military unit while they provided well basic conditions there military unit located nasosny some miles from living there with larger groupof people there were about people unit know there apoint when couldn even outside because went outside sawso much heartbreak around when hear false rumors false rumors were spread saying that destroyed villages razed them groundwith bulldozers didn know whether believe people know better idea that done revenge when arrived armenia spitak spitak those villages only intact that time even been protected just case they were guarded they better food than inhabitants spitak single person there died planning harm them around villages safe unharmed armenians didn attack anyone actually after evil magnitude suffered therecould have been feeling vengefulness acted tknow sometimes hear accusations effect that armenians guilty that they organized rumors like that being spread person says young ones hear they notonly perceive with their minds with their hearts them seems that older person telling truth example says know that people killed originally they said people later they found were armenian course upset utterly impossible discuss such things andnot become upset sometimes forget things know want return tothe time when were club across from city party committee when club building went because couldn believe that marched front carrying banner this repeat anything please excuse asked that here come here laugh these women strewn about floor overcrowding there tremendous completely unsanitary several children werealready sick true troops tried make livable they cooked their field stoves provided with wonderful food thing that their main ferret gang that still everywhere that continuing sordid affairs everywhere plus they were never given direct orders they didn know what they were authorizedto only march five clock eveningthat

what want talk about tried building take city partycommittee which across square from club took thehand said worry will have talk office told after everything have done believe iota what city party committee will disappear traces will disappear because stand when there another interesting detail from that meeting even very funny although time wasn laughing nice expensive shame speak said come here duded like london dandy smell good perfume your starched shirt have your expensive cameto ridicule poor women children lying floor arealready getting sick whose relatives have died come laugh atthem accompanying know what title quickly snatched head then said marauders didn come with intention stealing well kill kill says guilty kill kill notguilty fine guilty have your give answer asking where were when they were torturing raping those poor women when they were killing children burning things carrying outrageously wrecking those apartments where were then know didn expect know what didn anticipate that something like that would happen started laughing said truly funny says what could didn know what sorry will ridiculous tell first secretary city party committee shouldn march front with banner should fall down that gang would have cross over dead body that what should have done that during single party committee secretary compromised himself either died people into battle what away left marched with flag because were afraid excuse language feared your damned hide when tell that confused what could have done that right told city party committee confused party committees confused police confused confused they faint weeks gang show with impunity weren troops wouldn have been just days there wouldn single armenian left sure they would have finished their bloody affair because they brazenly went some russians ones tried something them they told them soon finish with armenians will come after there colonel took military unit wasthe with light blue collar tabs flew hours laterarrived armored personnel carrier when were took tothe military unit later started moving from military unit asked what what will come openly said know main thing catch that gang will finish that quickly willstay military unit time being will decide later general procuracy ussr arrived consists investigators from cities there were some from from everywhere just everywhere because affair truly frightful about this comrade spoke everyone knows first deputy general procurator ussr when gave speech from armored personnel carrier military unit told honest truth because couldn because still experiencing first impressions what seen said there afghanistan ishorrible people dared such thing will severely punished accordance with laws that quote then mother throws herself himher sons died before very eyesand says will return sons going punish culprits they tried calm down said order conduct proper investigation order that single scoundrel avoid responsibility must help because know maybe there someone else gang being concealed homes maybe neighbors know maybe someone something afraid write about detail that afraid everyone knows that many afraid having lived through such horrors they think that they write whole truth about their neighbor someone else that they will seek revenge later going like going throw what write there need know wrote names people write made public need theinformation each every afraid each write what necessary they that gang made threats shouted threatening gibes about armenians must describe these people information into soldiers major guarded sure enough many people people didn even want write know woman asked came said russian same thing happen will happen please will give information please write down afraid there were likeher later after made speech wrote downeverything knew threw into know will factual picture will emerge from that information person thousands thousands simply have agree with that fact fact example should someone that black white really black first deputy chairman council ministers issr said husband were council ministers armenian found that present come convince people return their previous dwellings their apartments asked meeting with granted when went tried behave properly very politely delicately when truth told right face when asked some same questions asked where wereyou personally when they were beating trying convince return didn think time that they were slaughtering where leading says telling truth mince words have told right face will tell straight will tell pure truth gotten evening whole government including were restraining crowd about never expected that city like with fine international record such thing could happen expected that means expected same were expecting says know just happened that were expecting were trying restrain fine didn know first three four hours then should have known help says well didn know what todo things like that basically same story from later when said back situation favorable everything fine armenians friendly with this answered know what speaking with member neutral nation have never argued with armenians with eyewitness tell please comrade asked what would about thishonestly were being completely frank with then said admit that honestly ashamed shame entire nation have disgraced ourselves only before entire soviet_union before whole world because voice america other foreign radio stations various hues branding with kinds rumors there nothing what really happened think ispossible anything more awful says agree with understand your pain truly unfortunate occurrence repeat that hesaid unfortunate occurrence then suddenly remembered himself what sayinghe hands fidgeting with nervouslyand said excuse tragedy really take this mean that really thinks unfortunate occurrence course says understand that having gone through this return necessary cool down realize that those people being tried even gave detail which know matters that policemen were being tried specifically relation that bloody affair there another good detail work after events went undergarment plant there working there suddenly tells what they didn tnail your husband they screwed floored hadn imagined thatanyone could something like that well after that went upto office needed find about those days what wasgoing happen with them they were going down those days from february march administrator told know head conductors pool grateful they down unexcused absence really discouraged this they know that were hair away from death barely survived here they telling that skipping work though enjoying myself somewhere went office chief pool last nameis that position many years incidentally party member town suddenly when went said comrade this looked askanceand said knows previous last name didyou wrapped this mess what mean wrapped this mess husband armenian tell have armenian last name screwed face made kind grimace though eaten something sour said didn expect that would what mean that should behave chief thepool supervises workers true there reduction sure there still conductors working someone supervises staff that size says things like that then what expect from simple uneducated politically person going believe rumors that armenians like this armenians like that that going back office when asked really going guarantee safety lives return answered know would guarantee them twant take much would guarantee them firmly years guarantee them longer than years have anotherthing like that planned years from they will quiet then another years will happen again couldn contain myself more also told that point certainly knewabout they were treating russians example they were hounded from their jobs certainly wrote some myself respond them everyone ignore what going didn prepare people this treated them says know finally starting insult threw desk maybe will scoundrel know talking about because know about ones know with conviction that comrade involved this that that because know certain well anyway assured that here there were false rumors that armenians were here were gotten back work everyone working said life very good drove about town ourselves comrade arutiunian first secretary communist party armenia came from council ministers armenian came brought information showing that everything fine when asked reached that conclusion said well walked down street said walking down street city even were new_york would never understand would guest have contact with people spend days among some bluecollar workers such that they didn know were first deputy chairman council ministers hear something quite different told example that drew conclusion when left military unit look apartments they tookus turns pick things since people fled military unit they just save themselves soon possible neighbors microdistrict will they view what they think thought maybe that fact wasn something general mass nature something when that took building because itwas same while were going apartment armed soldier accompanied what does that speaks fact that everything there were fine need have soldiers there come back withus going from apartment apartment fact especially with young people could sense delight misfortune grins they were making comments that presence troops when were microdistricts armored personnel carriers tanks were passing people taking such malicious delight when situation like that then what going like when they withdraw protection from city altogether there will more
